# Dreamcast Cht Builder

.cht files can be created by comparing byte arrays differences between an original game executable and a modified one.
This program does automate the process, creating a valid .cht file for you.

It has been tested with Retroarch (Flycast core), for any bug reports feel free to contact me on patreon/VincentNL

# How To Use:

1) Select unpatched executable (i.e. 1ST_READ.bin)
2) Select patched executable
3) Choose where to save .cht file
